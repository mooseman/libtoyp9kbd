     DESCRIPTION
          The console device serves a one-level directory giving
          access to the console and miscellaneous information.

          Reading the cons file returns characters typed on the key-
          board.  Normally, characters are buffered to enable erase
          and kill processing.  A control-U, `^U', typed at the key-
          board kills the current input line (removes all characters
          from the buffer of characters not yet read via cons), and a
          backspace erases the previous non-kill, non-erase character
          from the input buffer.  Killing and erasing only delete
          characters back to, but not including, the last newline.
          Characters typed at the keyboard actually produce 21-bit
          runes (see utf(6)), but the runes are translated into the
          variable-length UTF encoding (see utf(6)) before putting
          them into the buffer.  A read(2) of length greater than zero
          causes the process to wait until a newline or a `^D' ends
          the buffer, and then returns as much of the buffer as the
          argument to read allows, but only up to one complete line.

          A terminating `^D' is not put into the buffer.  If part of
          the line remains, the next read will return bytes from that
          remainder and not part of any new line that has been typed
          since.

          If the string rawon has been written to the consctl file and
          the file is still open, cons is in raw mode: characters are
          not echoed as they are typed, backspace, `^U' and `^D' are
          not treated specially, and characters are available to read
          as soon as they are typed.  Ordinary mode is reentered when
          rawoff is written to consctl or this file is closed.

          A write (see read(2)) to cons causes the characters to be
          printed on the console screen.

          The osversion file contains a textual representation of the
          operating system's version and parameters.  At the moment,
          it contains one field: the 9P protocol version, currently
          2000.

          The config file contains a copy of the kernel configuration
          file used to build the kernel.
