NAME
          kbd - pc keyboard driver

     SYNOPSIS
          bind -a #b /dev

     DESCRIPTION
          The kbd device serves a one-level directory containing the
          files scancode and leds.

          Reading the scancode file returns the raw scancode stream as
          it is emitted by the keyboard device without any transla-
          tion. It is usually kbdfs(8) task to interpret the scancodes
          and provide device independent keyboard input to programs.
          The scancode file can be only opened once by the hostowner.

          Writing a number to the write-only leds file changes the
          status leds on the keyboard. the value of the number is the
          addition of 1, 2 and 4 representing activated Scroll, Num
          and Caps leds.

     EXAMPLE
          Set the Scroll and Caps leds:
          echo 5 >/dev/leds
